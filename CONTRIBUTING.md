# Contributing to statusline

This guide is for contributors to the `statusline` plugin repository. The
repository is pre-release: the pure-Lua implementation, tests, and governance
scaffolding exist, but no release has shipped and interfaces may change.

## Repository ground rules

- Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) before making any change. It defines authority,
  scope boundaries, CarryCtx workflow, toolchain policy, and the security and
  privacy constraints that override convenience.
- Canonical plugin architecture, API, packaging, compatibility, and security
  contracts live in `bitty-docs` and `bitty-plugins-docs`. This repository must
  not invent capabilities, lifecycle semantics, or release policy
  independently.
- Never commit, push, publish packages, or mutate remote state without
  explicit authorization from the owning task.

## Prerequisites

Toolchain expectations (dependency versions are pinned in
[package.json](package.json) and locked in `bun.lock`; never invoke formatters
or linters by name):

- `just` — command runner owning all quality-gate invocations.
- `bun` / `bun run <bin>` — JavaScript execution and package management; the
  justfile invokes installed tools as `bun run <bin>`. Never use `npm`, `npx`,
  or `yarn` in any Bitty repository.
- `markdownlint-cli2`, `prettier`, `commitlint`, `lefthook`, `luaparse`, and
  the commit-pinned `bitty-plugin-sdk` linter — materialized by `just install`
  and invoked through the justfile.

## Development setup

1. Enter this repository before running Git, CarryCtx, or toolchain commands.
2. Install pinned development dependencies: `just install`.
3. Enable Git hooks (optional): `just hooks-install`.
4. Run all quality gates: `just check` (Markdown lint, Prettier format check,
   manifest validation, Lua parse, and the behavior and conformance tests; CI
   runs the same aggregate target).
5. Record scoped work in CarryCtx (task, session, progress, checkpoint) and
   stop at review; independent review is required for acceptance.

## Delivery lifecycle

Changes follow Issue -> Branch -> Commit -> Pull Request -> Review -> Merge,
where independent review plus required CI must pass before merge.

Every pull request states its Issue and CarryCtx task links, impact areas,
security and privacy impact, reproducible gate evidence, and documentation
synchronization status. Labels (`feat`/`fix`/`docs`/`chore`, `P0`/`P1`/`P2`,
`area:*`) and milestone `v0.1.0` are kept in sync.

## Contributor branches

The project is managed with CarryCtx, and official branches follow the task
convention `ctx-XXXX/<type>-<slug>`, where `XXXX` is the owning task id,
`<type>` is one of `feat|fix|chore|docs`, and the slug is short kebab-case.
Housekeeping branches use `cmd/<slug>`.

External contributors must use a distinguishable prefix such as
`<github-handle>/<type>-<slug>` so their branches are never confused with
maintainer task branches.

## Capabilities and privacy

Manifest capability requests are deny by default and must stay minimal. The
plugin requests only `terminal.semantic-read` and `ui.rich`; any wider request
requires an explicitly scoped task plus a reviewed privacy and security note.
Never add high-risk capabilities, install scripts, secrets, or ambient
authority as a side effect of an unrelated change.

## Workflow snapshots

The engineering workflow snapshot lives in this repository on the branch
`refs/heads/carryctx-snapshots`. Merges run `just workflow-publish` (dry run:
`just workflow-publish-dry`) as part of the commander closeout; snapshots are
redacted publication artifacts and are never merged back. Fresh clones restore
with `just workflow-import` (`just workflow-import-dry`).

## Reporting

Report bugs and feature requests through the GitHub issue templates. Report
security issues privately per [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
