# Security Policy

This document is proposed repository governance scaffolding. It describes how
security reports for this repository are handled. Normative product security
requirements live in the canonical `bitty-docs` security corpus and take
precedence over anything stated here.

## Supported Versions

| Version    | Supported                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Unreleased | No — no version of this project has been released |

There are currently no supported releases. Do not rely on this repository for
production use.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report security vulnerabilities privately by opening a
[GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/bitty-terminal/statusline/security/advisories/new).

Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull
requests, or discussion channels.

When reporting, please include as much of the following as possible:

- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept.
- Affected files, templates, manifests, or generated outputs.
- Any known mitigations or workarounds.

## Disclosure Policy

Reports are handled through coordinated disclosure:

1. The report is acknowledged and triaged privately.
2. A fix is developed and validated out of public view.
3. Once releases exist, a release containing the fix is published.
4. A public advisory is published afterward, crediting the reporter unless
   anonymity is requested.

## Response Expectations

The targets below are proposed policy and take effect once this repository
accepts them:

- Acknowledge a new advisory within 5 business days.
- Provide a status update at least every 14 calendar days while a report is
  open.
- Publish the advisory after a fixed version is available, or after 90 days if
  no fix is feasible, whichever comes first.
